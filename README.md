# arduDynaThrust
**********************************************************************************************************************************
This is an open source project for develop a bench with sensors for measure mechanical effiency of brushless motors and propellers
**********************************************************************************************************************************
This project have three main parts :
Mainboard - Eagle 7.6.0.                                                                                                                  
The bench - Acrylic laser cut pieces.                                                                                                             
GUI software for control, display and save the imput data from the bench - Processing.                                                                                  

The purpouse of this "Ardubench" is for find a best combination of motors and propellers for our drones - planes and copters.  
I hope you enjoy this little project , maybe for see that or do it :)
